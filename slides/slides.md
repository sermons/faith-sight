Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, <br/>
was not with the disciples when Jesus came.

<span class="ref">25</span>
So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”

那十二個門徒中， 有稱為低土馬的多馬； <br/>
耶穌來的時候， 他沒有和他們同在。

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">25</span>
那些門徒就對他說： 我們已經看見主了。

But he said to them, <br/>
“Unless I see the nail marks in his hands <br/>
and put my finger where the nails were, <br/>
and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”

<div class="zh">
多馬卻說： 我非看見他手上的釘痕， <br/>
用指頭探入那釘痕， <br/>
又用手探入他的肋旁， <br/>
我總不信。

A week later his disciples were in the house again, <br/>
and Thomas was with them.

Though the doors were locked, <br/>
Jesus came and stood among them and said, <br/>
“Peace be with you!”

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">26</span>
過了八日， 門徒又在屋裡， <br/>
多馬也和他們同在， <br/>
門都關了。 耶穌來， <br/>
站在當中說： 願你們平安！

Then he said to Thomas, <br/>
“Put your finger here; see my hands. <br/>
Reach out your hand and put it into my side. <br/>
Stop doubting and believe.”

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">27</span>
就對多馬說： <br/>
伸過你的指頭來， 看我的手； <br/>
伸出你的手來， 探入我的肋旁。 <br/>
不要疑惑， 總要信。

Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">28</span>
多馬說： 我的主！ 我的神！

Then Jesus told him, <br/>
“Because you have seen me, you have believed;

blessed are those who have not seen <br/>
and yet have believed.”

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">29</span>
耶穌對他說：
你因看見了我才信；
那沒有看見就信的有福了。

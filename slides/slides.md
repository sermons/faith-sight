Now **Thomas** (known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, <br/>
was **not** with the disciples when Jesus came.

<span class="ref">25</span>
So the **other** disciples told him, “We have **seen** the Lord!”

<span class="ref">24</span>
<span class="zh">
那十二個門徒中， 有稱為低土馬的 **多馬** ； <br/>
耶穌來的時候， 他 **沒有** 和他們同在。
</span>

<span class="ref">25</span>
<span class="zh">
那些 **門徒** 就對他說： 我們已經 **看見** 主了。

But he said to them, <br/>
“Unless I see the **nail marks** in his hands <br/>
and put my **finger** where the nails were, <br/>
and put my **hand** into his side, I **will not** believe.”

<div class="zh">
多馬卻說： 我非看見他手上的 **釘痕** ， <br/>
用 **指頭** 探入那釘痕， <br/>
又用 **手** 探入他的肋旁， <br/>
**我總不信** 。

<span class="ref">26</span>
A week later his disciples were in the house again, <br/>
and **Thomas** was with them.

Though the doors were **locked**, <br/>
**Jesus** came and stood among them and said, <br/>
“**Peace** be with you!”

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">26</span>
過了八日， 門徒又在屋裡， <br/>
**多馬** 也和他們同在， <br/>
門都 **關** 了。 **耶穌** 來， <br/>
站在當中說： 願你們 **平安** ！
</div>

<span class="ref">27</span>
Then he said to Thomas, <br/>
“Put your **finger** here; see my **hands**. <br/>
Reach out your **hand** and put it into my **side**. <br/>
Stop **doubting** and **believe**.”

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">27</span>
就對多馬說： <br/>
伸過你的 **指頭** 來， 看我的 **手** ； <br/>
伸出你的 **手** 來， 探入我的 **肋旁** 。 <br/>
不要 **疑惑**， 總要 **信**。

Thomas said to him, “**My Lord** and **my God**!”

多馬說： **我的主**！ **我的神**！

<span class="ref">29</span>
Then Jesus told him, <br/>
“Because you have **seen** me, you have **believed**;

blessed are those who have **not seen** <br/>
and yet have **believed**.”

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">29</span>
耶穌對他說： <br/>
你因 **看見了** 我才 **信**； <br/>
那 **沒有看見** 就 **信** 的有福了。

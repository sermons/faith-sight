Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, <br/>
was not with the disciples when Jesus came.

<span class="ref">25</span>
So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”

But he said to them, <br/>
“Unless I see the nail marks in his hands <br/>
and put my finger where the nails were, <br/>
and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”

A week later his disciples were in the house again, <br/>
and Thomas was with them.

Though the doors were locked, <br/>
Jesus came and stood among them and said, <br/>
“Peace be with you!”

Then he said to Thomas, <br/>
“Put your finger here; see my hands. <br/>
Reach out your hand and put it into my side. <br/>
Stop doubting and believe.”

<span class="ref">28</span>
Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”

Then Jesus told him, <br/>
“Because you have seen me, you have believed;

blessed are those who have not seen <br/>
and yet have believed.”

That which was from the **beginning**, <br/>
which we have **heard**, which we have **seen** with our eyes, <br/>
which we have **looked** at and our hands have **touched** <br/>
-- this we **proclaim** concerning the Word of life.

<div class="zh">
論到從起初原有的生命之道， <br/>

親眼**看過**、 親手**摸過**的。

If Christ has not been **raised**, your faith is **futile**; <br/>
you are still in your **sins**.  <br/>

we are of all people most to be **pitied**.

你們仍在罪裡。 <br/>
<span class="ref">19</span>
我們若靠基督， 只在今生有指望， <br/>
就算比眾人更可憐。
